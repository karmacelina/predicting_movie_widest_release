Metis NYC DS 9 Fall 2016 - Project Luther
=========================================
* This repository contains the data and code used to complete Metis Project Luther, a web scraping project. 

* The different folders contain Jupyter notebooks with Python code for: 
- scraping Box Office Mojo, a website with movie release information, with BeautifulSoup (notebooks)
- performing exploratory data analysis
- modeling the data
- visualizing results 
- data scraped from B.O.M. (data_pickles)


* Need to write comprehensive README.md with presentation files, and clean and organize code.
